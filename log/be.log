When users approach the checkout on e-commerce sites, you use behavioral insights to help them reflect on their current spending patterns. You should generate messages based on the following principles, using data like weekly/monthly budget limits, recent category-specific spending, and typical spending behaviors. Messages should be supportive, not restrictive, and framed to encourage reflection rather than enforce rules.

Message Guidelines:
Budget Reminders:

If the user is near or at their budget limit for a category, remind them with an encouraging tone:
“You have £50 left in your shopping budget this week. Consider holding off on this purchase to stay within your limit.”
Pattern Awareness:

For spikes in recent spending, provide gentle, context-based suggestions:
“This week’s spending trend shows a spike in dining out. Could reallocating £30 from dining to savings help keep you on track?”
Alternative Options:

When applicable, suggest alternative actions to reduce current spending or redirect funds:
“Your dining out expenses have been high lately. Would you like suggestions for affordable meal options to help save this month?”
{"message":"Hello from background.js"}, Chatbot response: Based on the transaction data provided, here are some reflections and suggestions in line with the guidelines for budget reminders, pattern awareness, and alternative options:

1. **Budget Reminders:**
   - Apparel Spending: On October 18th and 19th, there were significant expenses on Nike shoes totaling £828. If you have a specific budget for apparel, consider reviewing your remaining balance to ensure it aligns with your spending goals.

2. **Pattern Awareness:**
   - Dining and Food: There are frequent small expenses related to food, such as groceries and dining out. This includes items like breakfast and snacks. Reviewing these could help identify if reallocating some of this spending to savings might be beneficial.

3. **Alternative Options:**
   - Subscription Services: With expenses like Netflix and mobile data boosts, consider checking if there are more cost-effective plans or bundles that could reduce monthly costs.
   - Apparel Alternatives: If the spending on clothing and shoes is high, exploring affordable clothing options or sales could help manage the budget better.

These insights aim to encourage thoughtful reflection on current spending habits and help align with personal financial goals. - chatbot - chat_with_bot

hi, i want to buy a diamond ring for 500 but my budget this month is 600, am I on track to reach my savings target?, Chatbot response: Based on the provided data, your monthly budget is £600. You are considering purchasing a diamond ring for £500. To determine if you're on track to reach your savings target, let's review your spending for the month. Here are notable expenses:

- Apparel: £368 (Shoes) + £18.4 (Clothes)
- Subscriptions: £1.83 (Netflix)
- Transfers to funds: £46 (Small Cap Fund 1) + £46 (Small Cap Fund 2)
- Miscellaneous: £92 (Money Transfer), food, and other small expenses

Totaling these expenses: 

- Apparel: £386.4
- Subscriptions: £1.83
- Transfers: £92 (total across funds)
- Miscellaneous: £92 (Money Transfer)

Total spent so far is approximately £572.23. Adding the diamond ring purchase of £500 would bring your total to about £1072.23, which exceeds your budget by £472.23.

Given you're already close to your budget limit without accounting for the ring, purchasing it would significantly surpass your budget and impact your savings target. Consider if this purchase aligns with your financial goals and if there are adjustments or alternatives that could help you stay on track. - chatbot - chat_with_bot
